gazzabazza.net
==============

Artistic project based in randomness.

I did the website www.gazzabazza.net long time ago, when i started to learn how to code and, unfortunately, i was learnt .asp.
If anyone is interested in spending some time codyfing the project to .php or any linux based language, you are very welcome.
I think there would be some improvements to do.

Regards everyone!
